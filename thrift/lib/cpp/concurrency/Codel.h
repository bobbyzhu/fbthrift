 * Algorithm modified slightly:  Instead of changing the interval time
 * based on the average min delay, instead we use an alternate timeout
 * for each task if the min delay during the interval period is too
 * high.
 *
 * This was found to have better latency metrics than changing the
 * window size, since we can communicate with the sender via thrift
 * instead of only via the tcp window size congestion control, as in TCP.
